        <h2>Hi all! </h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>My name is Sergey Voytov. I was born in Russia and moved to the USA 9 years ago. That amazing
            chance was given by the US government through Green Card lottery. In 2011 I went to San Antonio for military
            training.
            I served for 6 years in the United States Air Force.
            <p>I had chance to get multiple degrees. I have associate in pharmacy
                technology. And I got a BS and MS from my university in Russia in industrial engineering.
                I just moved to Seattle 1 week and Iâ€™m trying to learn about good places to eat and spend time with my
                family.</p>
        </p>
        <p>My main goal is become good software developer</p>
